## Api Keys


In order to queue transactions for Ethereum Accounts, a service must be registered as a 'provider'.  This allows users to subcribe to providers and filter incoming queued transactions.  


### Providers 

A Inkroll Provider is any service that builds EVM transactions, such as a web3 bot or a defi application.   These transactions can be queued for users using the Inkroll api.   Then, those users (public address wallet) will see those queued transactions.
